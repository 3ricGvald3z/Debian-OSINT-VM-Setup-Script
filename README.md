### :floppy_disk: Features

This script is a powerful, all-in-one solution that performs the following tasks:

-   **System Hardening:** Configures DNS to use secure public resolvers.
    
-   **Core Dependencies:** Installs essential packages from Debian repositories, including tools for networking, forensics, and more.
    
-   **Service Configuration:** Automatically starts and enables key services like SSH and PostgreSQL.
    
-   **Database Setup:** Installs and configures MongoDB for rapid use with various tools.
    
-   **Language-Specific Tools:** Installs a wide array of tools via `pipx` (Python), `gem` (Ruby), and `go` (GoLang).
    
-   **Git-based Tools:** Clones and sets up numerous OSINT tools from GitHub, creating dedicated virtual environments for each.
    
-   **Resource Collection:** Downloads and organizes valuable resource repositories, including cheatsheets and dork lists.
    

### :hammer_and_wrench: How to Use

#### 1. Download the Script & Golang

Clone this repository or simply download the `install_osint_vm.sh` file.

```
git clone https://github.com/3ricGvald3z/Debian-OSINT-VM-Setup-Script.git
cd Debian-OSINT-VM-Setup-Script


```

#### 2. Make the Script Executable

Before running, you must grant execute permissions to the script.

```
chmod +x install_osint_vm.sh


```

#### 3. Run the Script

Execute the script with `sudo` privileges. This is necessary for system-wide package installations and service configurations.

```
sudo ./install_osint_vm.sh


```

#### 4. Post-Installation

Once the script completes, your Debian VM will be fully equipped. The script provides clear `[INFO]` and `[SUCCESS]` messages throughout the process.

> **Note:** Some tools are installed in `~/programs` and `~/go/bin`. Remember to add `~/go/bin` to your system's `PATH` if it's not already configured.

### :scroll: Script Structure

The script is modular and organized into functions for clarity.

-   `update_system()`: Updates and upgrades the system.
    
-   `configure_dns()`: Sets up DNS resolvers.
    
-   `install_debian_packages()`: Installs all required APT packages.
    
-   `configure_services()`: Starts and enables system services.
    
-   `install_mongodb()`: Installs and sets up MongoDB.
    
-   `install_ruby_gems_and_snaps()`: Installs Ruby gems and Snap packages.
    
-   `install_pipx_tools()`: Installs Python tools via pipx.
    
-   `install_go_tools()`: Installs Go-based tools.
    
-   `install_git_and_python_tools()`: Clones Git repositories and sets up Python virtual environments.
    
-   `install_git_repo()`: A helper function to automate Git cloning and installation.
    

### :lock: Security & Best Practices

-   **Review the Code:** Always review a script before running it with `sudo`.
    
-   **Virtual Machine:** It is highly recommended to use this script within a virtual machine or a controlled environment.
    
-   **Networking:** Be mindful of network traffic generated by some of these tools.
